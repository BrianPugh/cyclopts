Documentation
=============
Documentation is a major component of any library.

Typer's documentation contains many good tutorials and demonstrations on how to use the library, **but has very little information on the API itself**.

Frequently the only way to discover options and behavior is to dive into the source code.
This becomes further confusing as the lines of where Typer ends and Click begins is quite blurred.

Cyclopts has a full :ref:`API` page, containing all the configurable options and defined behaviors in a single place.
