===================
Arguably Comparison
===================
Arguably_ is another Typer-inspired type-annotation-based CLI library.
Arguably was created in response to the overly intrusive nature of Typer, with the goal of minimizing clutter and maintaining code simplicity.
Like Cyclopts, Arguably mostly skirts using :obj:`Annotated` by interpreting as much data as possible from the function docstring.
Unlike the :ref:`Typer comparison <Typer Comparison>`, many of the topics in this section are simply comparing/contrasting with Arguably, rather than claiming to be strictly better.
