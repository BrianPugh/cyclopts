===================
Arguably Comparison
===================
Arguably_ is another type-annotation-based CLI library that aims to introduce the least amount of clutter to your code as possible.
Arguably was also inspired by Typer_, but was developed out of the dislike of how intrusive Typer is to the decorated function.
Arguably mostly skirts using ``Annotated`` by interpreting as much data as possible from the function docstring.
